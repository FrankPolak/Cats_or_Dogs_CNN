# Cats and Dogs - Convolutional Neural Network Model
This is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model that predicts whether an image depicts a cat or a dog. This model was built in TensorFlow.

## Making a prediction
To try out the model locally, please download both the cats_or_dogs.h5 and cats_or_dogs.py files. The cats_or_dogs.py programme can be executed from the terminal as such:
```bash
chmod +x cats_or_dogs.py
python3 cats_or_dogs.py test_image.jpg
```
Please replace test_image.jpg with the path to image for prediction. cats_or_dogs.py will require cetrain dependencies such as TensorFlow and Pillow, which may have to be installed manually prior to execution.
